As of Christmas 2022, we no longer use custom docker images, as in fact the standard SWISH image built with https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/docker-swish 
suffices for our needs, ergo the deprecation of the older dockerfiles.

To ensure a specific version we use image logicalcontracts/swish-xmas2022-multi , which is simply the above built for SWISH version 
b6a80911995e809ac92cf75c1df7c07385caae6f (Dec 15, 2022) and with:

    docker buildx build --push --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 -t logicalcontracts/swish-xmas2022-multi .

You may have to execute this first:
    docker buildx create --use

Cf. https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/

Running for testing a server in developer machine: 

    HACK: before the next command, setupo some dir in your host for swish data, and do this once (notice that the source dir does NOT exist on your host, 
    but it will exist inside the container):
    
         ln -s /app/swish/config-enabled /Users/mc/taxlog_swish_data

docker run -it -p 8082:3050 -v /Users/mc/taxlog_swish_data:/data  -v /Users/mc/git/LogicalEnglish:/app -e LOAD_KB=true  --memory="300m" logicalcontracts/swish-xmas2022-multi

Add --bash to the end if you want to peek inside the container.


On Ubuntu server:

    chown -R 1000:1000 /home/ubuntu/taxlog_swish_data

In  particular, it's important that the data subdirectory's user is not root, because it is used to run SWISH and thus interact woth the filesystem

And finally:

docker run -d --restart always -p 8082:3050 -v /home/ubuntu/taxlog_swish_data:/data:rw -v /home/ubuntu/LogicalEnglish:/app:rw -e LOAD_KB=true --memory="300m"  logicalcontracts/swish-xmas2022-multi
